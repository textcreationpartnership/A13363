            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Sphere is a maſsie body, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with one platforme; and in the middle of it ther is a pricke: from which, all lines drawne to the ſaid platforme, are equall each to other, and that pricke is the Center of the Globe, and ſo ſayth <hi>Enclid.</hi>

The Axeltree is a right lyne (which mooueth not) and paſſeth through the Center of the Globe, at which ends are imagined the Poles of the world; one is named the North Pole, the other the South.</p>
            <p>The North Pole is called, <hi>Pole Artick</hi> and the other Pole in the the South, <hi>Antarticke:</hi> the South Pole is neuer ſeene of vs in this our Countrey, but is euermore vnder our Horizonte.

The Meridian is a great Circle paſſing ouer our heades, in which Circle when the Sunne is, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the middle of the day and the middle of the night.

degrees to take the Altitude of the North ſtarre, this ſtarre is in the extremitie, or end of the tayle of the leſſe Beare, being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, commonly called the Horne: for this North ſtarre (of the moſt notableſt ſtarres aboue the Pole) is neereſt vnto it, &amp; ſhall therefore ſhewe a leſſe Circle than any other, and ſo ſhall his Altitude differ little from the Altitude of the Pole.</p>
               <p>This ſtarre hath declination 85. degrees, and 51. minutes, and the complement of nintie (which are foure degrees and nine minutes) is his diſtance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pole. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

And likewiſe by thys expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may be known the Altitude of the Pole, and what all the other ſtarres that goe not downe vnder the Horizonte, be diſtant from it, ioyning the greater Altitude with the leſſe: and that ſhall amount thereof, deuided by the halfe, ſhall bee the Altitude of the Pole; and taking awaye this Altitude of the Pole, from the greater Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Starre, or the leſſe

And for this is conſidered, the poſition of the former Guardes or Watch, beeing one of the two ſtarres called the Guardes, which are in the mouth of the Horne: the Marriners haue noted eyght poſitions, from the former Guard ſtarre to the North ſtarre, which aunſwereth to the eyght principall windes; and as the Guarde is to the North ſtarre, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>FIRST, you ſhall vnderſtand, that 15. myles difference from Eaſt toward Weſt, doth make the Sunne ryſing, the nooneſteed, and Sunne ſetting, to be later by one minute of an hower: &amp; ſo 30. miles, 2. minutes: 120. myles, 8. minutes: 225. myles, 15. minutes: which is a quarter of an hower.

And 2000. myles Weſt from London, it was then with them, but 10. of the clock and 13. minutes in the fore noone: the difference of theſe 3. places, one from the other, is to bee founde by the Rules in Arithmatique, as followeth.</p>

               <p>There bee ſome perſons that make a great obſcuritie, in finding out the Longitudes in ſayling Eaſt and Weſt; a thing once knowne, &amp; of no great importance, as ready to bee found out as the Latitudes. A little Briefe (therfore) I will giue you, to vnderſtand the ſame skill.</p>
               <p>Let the Marriner, Sayler, or other
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13867:51"/>
perſons, prouide him a perfect Watch, or Clock, arteficially made by a Clock-maker. Let him ſet the ſame by the hower of the day in that place you are in, and to come by the true place of the Sunne, your Aſtrolob quadrant croſſe ſtaffe, or other Inſtrument, will ſerue you to take the heigth of the Sunne, &amp; to find out the true hower in euery ſeuerall Latitude, with the helpe of the Rules before. And the true hower beeing found of the day in this manner, ſette your Clocke or Watch. Then trauell either by Sea or Land, and when you are 40. myles, or 60. more or leſſe, diſtant of the place you went from, then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13867:52"/>
looke to your Clocke or Watch, howe many howers haue paſſed ſince you ſet on your iourney: then take your Quadrant or orther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, &amp; take the heigth of the Sunne in that place you are in; and if the time of the day taken with your Inſtrument, doe agree with your clock, be you ſure your place is North or South, from the place you came from, and therefore haue the ſame Longitude and Meridian lyne; But if the tyme differ, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the one out of the other, and the difference turne in degrees and minutes of the Equinoctiall: and 15. minutes of the Equinoctiall, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one minute of time, according
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13867:52"/>
vnto the Rules going before, you may thus knowe the Longitudes, difference of howers, and times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt any two places Eaſt or Weſt ward. The Latitudes are eaſily found out by the Altitudes of the North or South Poles, and alſo, by the Meridian heigth of the Sunne at noone.</p>

                  <p>I find the Sunne to poſſeſſe the 1. minute of <hi>Geminie:</hi> his heigth in the Meridian lyne at noone with vs heere at London, is 54, degrees and 10, minutes, and his declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is 15, degrees and 40, minutes:

nowe I ſubſtract the declination out of the Sunnes heigth, &amp; there remayneth 39, degrees and 30, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, this I take from 90, degrees, and I find the place in height 51, degrees and 30, minutes; And this you muſt beare in memory, that if the Sunne haue South declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you muſt adde it to the ſayde Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: then adding or ſubſtracting that number from 90, degrees, ther ſhall remaine the true eleuation of the Pole.</p>
